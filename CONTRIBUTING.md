## Contribution

I welcome feedback, and pull requests. If there's something that you need to change in the library, please log an issue, and explain the problem. If you have a proposed solution, please write it up and explain why you think it is the answer to the problem. The best way to highlight a bug is to submit a pull request with a unit test that fails so I can clearly see what the problem is in the first place.

## Pull Requests

Please break pull requests up in to their smallest possible parts. If you have a small feature or refactor that other code depends on, try submitting that first. Please try to reference an issue so that I understand the context of the pull request. If there is no issue, I don't know what the code is about. If you need help, please jump on Join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hardwarewallets/shared_invite/enQtNTYwMjI4NTk3Mjg3LWU0ZDU5ZmE3OTNiOWNjNDVkNjU3ZmVmYmZmMjAzYTY4ZWMzMzk3NjdjZTBmMDU1ZTlhMTg2MGRhZDBmODBlNGY)

**Please submit pull requests to the develop branch. Please do not submit to the master branch**
