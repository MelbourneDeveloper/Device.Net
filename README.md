# Hid.Net, Usb.Net, SerialPort.Net (Device.Net)

![diagram](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/blob/main/Diagram.png)

**Cross-platform .NET framework for talking to connected devices such as USB, Serial Port and Hid devices**

### Version 4.x 
is live on [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Device.Net)! Take a look at the [4.0 project](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/projects/11) to see new features and fixes. Version 4 has public interface changes. You will need to read through the documentation to upgrade from version 3 to version 4.

#### New in 4.3.0-beta

- You can do USB [control transfer from an Android host](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/pull/216).
- Cancellation tokens are [fixed](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/pull/215) for Hid devices

This framework provides a common Task async programming interface across platforms and device types. This allows for dependency injection to use different types of devices on any platform with the same code. The supported device types are Hid, Serial Port, and USB.

This project also needs unit tests, bug fixes and work towards more platforms. Please [read this](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Licensing

This framework uses the [MIT license](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net/blob/main/LICENSE). I won't sue you, or your business if you use this for free. If you are developing software for free, I don't expect you to sponsor me. However, if your business makes more than USD 100,000 per year and your software depends on Device.Net, I expect your business to make a serious contribution via [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/MelbourneDeveloper). 

### Why Device.Net?

Device communication is fragmented across platforms and device types. If you need to use three different device types across Android, UWP and .NET, you would otherwise need nine different APIs. Device.Net puts a standard layer across all these so that you can share code across all platforms and device types. You don't need to use Windows APIs or learn about Android's API directly. If the device manufacturer decides to switch from USB to Hid, the code remains the same. Write once; run everywhere.

*Note: Bluetooth, Linux, and macOS, WebAssembly (via [WebUsb](https://web.dev/usb/)) support are on the radar. If you can sponsor this project, you might be able to help get there faster.*

*SerialPort.Net and Device.Net.LibUsb are still in alpha mode. You must use the prerelease version*

            //----------------------
